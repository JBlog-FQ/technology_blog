# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building fast, SEO-friendly websites easier than ever before. Whether you're building a blog, e-commerce site, or enterprise application, Next.js provides the tools you need to create amazing user experiences.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering** - Improve SEO and initial load performance
- **Static Site Generation** - Pre-render pages at build time for even faster performance
- **API Routes** - Create serverless functions with ease
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive and easy to understand
- **Built-in CSS Support** - Use CSS Modules, Sass, or your preferred styling solution

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features

### Pages and Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Any file in the `pages` directory becomes a route automatically.

```
pages/
  index.js         // Route: /
  about.js         // Route: /about
  blog/
    index.js       // Route: /blog
    [slug].js      // Route: /blog/:slug
```

### Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data:

1. **getStaticProps** - Fetch data at build time
2. **getStaticPaths** - Specify dynamic routes to pre-render
3. **getServerSideProps** - Fetch data on each request

### API Routes

Create API endpoints by adding files to the `pages/api` directory:

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World!' })
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js makes modern web development simpler and more productive. It's the perfect choice for your next web project, providing all the tools needed to build performant and maintainable applications.
